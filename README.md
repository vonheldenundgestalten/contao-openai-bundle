# Contao OpenAI Bundle

The purpose of this extension is to quickly and easily generate meta descriptions and titles from page content using ChatGPT (OpenAI). Page content also includes dynamic pages generated through the Contao News extension.

In the screenshot below you can see some settings to get you started with relatively good results.

## Getting started

Install by hand / command line with
```
composer require vonheldenundgestalten/contao-openai-bundle
```
or through the Contao Manager interface.

Add this to the .htaccess of a project
```
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/_gpt*
```

## Compability

| Contao Version | PHP Version |

## Important note

- An OpenAI developer account is required. Sign up [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup). 
- The required token is also created [there](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- There is a fee to use the OpenAI API. An overview of OpenAI pricing can be found here: [https://openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing)
- We tested a lot and so far we haven't gotten more than $5 a month

## TinyMCE Plugin notes

Please make sure you don't have a custom be_tinyMCE.html5 template. If so, take a look at src/Resources/contao/templates/be_tinyMCE.html5 and adjust the relevant places manually.
